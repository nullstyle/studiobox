# @nullstyle/studiobox — Development Plan

Companion to DESIGN.md. Status: 2026-07-10, pre-M0. The repo is currently
design-only; M0 turns it into the committed foundation the design describes.

Guiding rule (inherited from the limabox plan and its production-readiness
review, and it bit us before): **do not start breadth work while a gate that
could force a redesign is open.** The gates are M1; everything wider waits.

## 1. Starting position

- `../limabox` holds an uncommitted M0 foundation: ~60 green host-safe tests,
  3 fake-VMM process-contract tests, five canonical capnp schemas, a
  129-symbol/473-member upstream parity audit, and four design docs (rev 5).
  It is the *source quarry* for studiobox — harvested, renamed, then left
  archival. Nothing further lands there.
- `jsr:@nullstyle/firecracker@0.2.0` is published and CI-green on both arches
  (its 13 integration gaps G1–G13 all have dispositions; the ones studiobox
  depends on — copy staging, no-adoption, journal-before-spawn, registry
  required when jailed — are library contracts now).
- `@nullstyle/capnp@0.1.0` is **published to JSR** (Level-1 RPC,
  interop-tested serde). The two blockers limabox hit were fixed upstream
  before release — `fix(codegen): use declaring interface ids and merge
  generated barrels` (the cross-file-import/barrel-collision class) and
  `fix(streaming): make sender drains re-entrancy safe and window-atomic`
  (the `maxInFlight` race) — but neither has been exercised against *our*
  five-schema bundle yet; M1 qualifies exactly that before breadth work.
  Studiobox pins `jsr:@nullstyle/capnp@^0.1`. **No vendored snapshots**
  (user decision, 2026-07-11): limabox's `vendor/capnp-deno` does not carry
  over.
- Upstream fidelity target `@deno/sandbox@0.13.2` is fully digested (API +
  wire semantics); the parity inventory transfers.

## 2. Carry-forward map (limabox → studiobox)

Mechanical rename throughout: `limabox→studiobox`, `lbx→sbx`, `LBX→SBX`,
`fchostd→studiobox-hostd`, `fclauncherd→studiobox-rootd`,
`sandboxd→studioboxd`, `/run/limabox→/run/studiobox`.

| limabox source | destination | disposition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `src/state/` (model, CAS store) | `src/state/` | **carry** — the create-only CAS journal, already tested |
| `src/fclauncher/firecracker/` (adapter, CreateOnlyVmRegistry, error normalization, execution IDs) | `src/rootd/firecracker/` | **carry** — battle-tested against the real package; re-pin imports to `jsr:@nullstyle/firecracker@^0.2` |
| `src/security/tickets.ts` | `src/security/` | **carry** |
| `src/transports/tunnel_preface.ts` | `src/transports/` | **carry** (magics → `SBXTUN1`/`SBXACK1`) |
| `src/fchost/tunnel_authorizer.ts` | `src/hostd/` | **carry** |
| `src/wire/` (contract, bootstrap gate, supervisor validators) | `src/wire/` | **carry** |
| `src/api/command.ts`, `process.ts`, `errors.ts` | `src/api/` | **carry** — real `sh` builder + KillController + taxonomy |
| `src/api/` abstract façade (sandbox, fs, deno, env, types) | `src/api/` | **carry as scaffold** — compile-compat shell until M8 installs a provider |
| `schema/*.capnp` (5 canonical) | `schema/` | **carry** — keep file IDs & ordinals, rename identifiers, re-hash bundle |
| `parity/` (inventory, member audit) | `parity/` | **carry** — expensive to reproduce |
| `compat/` + `tools/check_compat|wire|publish.ts` | same | **carry** — provenance gates |
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | same | **carry + extend** |
| `vendor/capnp-deno` snapshot | — | **drop** — replaced by `jsr:@nullstyle/capnp@^0.1` (published); `deno.local.json` maps to the `../capnp-deno` checkout for coordinated dev |
| `src/wire/generated/` (codegen_probe only) | — | **regenerate** in M1; probe carried as qualification fixture |
| 4 design docs | — | superseded by DESIGN.md/PLAN.md; keep `FIRECRACKER_INTEGRATION.md`'s G1–G13 table as `docs/firecracker-contract.md` |
| `@nullstyle/firecracker` raw-URL imports | — | **drop** — JSR pin + `deno.local.json` sibling override |

## 3. Milestones

Each milestone ends demoable and CI-green. Points are relative effort
(limabox's 73-pt scale, reduced by the transplant head start).

### M0 — Repo bring-up + transplant (5 pts)

Scaffold `deno.json` (JSR shape, exports stubs, tasks: `check`, `test`,
`test:vm`, `smoke:host`), LICENSE (Apache-2.0), `.gitignore`, CI skeleton.
Apply the carry-forward map with the mechanical rename. Pin
`jsr:@nullstyle/firecracker@^0.2` and `jsr:@nullstyle/capnp@^0.1`; add
`deno.local.json` sibling overrides for both.
**Exit:** all carried tests green on macOS (`deno task check && deno task
test`, ~60 unit/host-safe + 3 process-contract); CI green; history starts
committed (limabox's zero-commit mistake is not repeated).
**Demo:** clean clone → green board.

### M1 — Foundation qualification (8 pts) ← go/no-go

`@nullstyle/capnp@0.1.0` (JSR) claims fixes for both limabox-era blockers —
the codegen barrel/interface-id fix and the window-atomic stream sender.
M1 proves those claims against *our* workload before breadth work; any gap
goes upstream to `capnp-deno` and comes back as a patch release.

1. **Codegen:** generate all five canonical schemas with the published
   `capnpc-deno`; verify cross-file struct/interface imports resolve to real
   types (the old `AnyPointer` lowering) and barrels merge without
   collisions; commit bindings behind a `wire:check` drift gate. *Fallback
   if a gap resists upstream fixing (recorded, ugly, workable): merge the
   five schemas into one file.*
2. **Streaming bounds:** 1 GiB transfer soak holding `maxInFlight` and
   memory bounds under concurrent senders.
3. **Close/EOF ownership:** transport-close conformance tests (who closes,
   EOF propagation, no double-close) for `TcpTransport` over UDS/TCP/vsock
   conns.
4. **Compiled-runtime proof:** `deno compile` a probe binary embedding the
   capnp WASM from the JSR package (`--include`; the loader must resolve it
   via the package, not a repo-relative path), cross-compiled to
   linux-aarch64 + x86_64; prove an RPC round-trip from the compiled
   artifact. Also settle the in-guest vsock flag question (unstable flag or
   not) on the pinned Deno.

**Exit:** five schemas → committed drift-checked bindings from the published
toolchain; compiled probe does RPC on both arches; streaming soak green.
**Demo:** `deno task wire:check` + probe binary round-trip.

### M2 — Supervisor plane on fakes (6 pts)

`studiobox-rootd` v1: `supervisor.capnp` service over a UDS; launch / status
/ kill / reconcile / openBridge implemented against the **fake VMM + fake
jailer shims** from `@nullstyle/firecracker/testing` — all macOS-safe.
Journal wired end-to-end (SandboxRecord + nested JailRecord + execution IDs)
through the carried adapter.
**Exit tests:** kill -9 rootd mid-launch → restart → destructive reconcile
reaps everything, journal converges to `terminated(host-restart)`; stale
execution CAS rejection; bridge refuses unauthorized logical IDs.
**Demo:** scripted create→status→kill cycle on a Mac with no VM anywhere.

### M3 — studioboxd v1 + agent plane on fakes (8 pts)

The guest agent as a portable Deno service behind a transport seam (UDS/TCP
in dev, vsock in prod): `ProcessSpawner`/`Process` (spawn, stdio streaming
via `OutputSink`, kill/status/wait), `FileSystem` core (read/write/stat/
list/mkdir/remove/rename + streamed bodies), `Environment`, `DenoRuntime.eval`
(state-preserving REPL driver). Build **FakeSandboxHost** around it: an
in-process provider + agent over memory/UDS transport → the `./testing`
export. Start the **parity fixture suite** (same test file, upstream
semantics assertions) running against the fake.
**Exit:** parity fixtures for sh/spawn/fs/env/eval pass against
FakeSandboxHost on macOS; `deno compile` of studioboxd (both arches) boots
and serves the plane over UDS.
**Demo:** `Sandbox`-shaped calls executing against an in-process guest.

### M4 — Artifact pipeline (8 pts)

`images/`: kernel fetch + sha256 verify (per arch); golden rootfs build via
pinned debootstrap against `snapshot.debian.org` (user `sandbox`/uid 1000,
home `/home/app`, pinned Deno, studioboxd baked in, overlay-init); sparse
overlay creation; `manifest.json` + manifest-hash into `ContractIdentity`;
copy-only staging into jail layout; artifact cache + refcount GC under
`~/.studiobox/artifacts/`. Builds run inside the Lima VM (or any Linux with
loop devices).
**Exit:** `studiobox images build` produces a manifest-addressed set twice
with identical hashes (kernel/rootfs reproducible); staging drill copies into
a fake jail and never mutates the golden inode (regression test).
**Demo:** one command → verified artifact set.

### M5 — First real microVM (in-VM happy path) (8 pts)

Inside `studiobox-host-<arch>`: rootd + real jailer + real Firecracker boots
the M4 image; studioboxd comes up on real vsock; `probeAgent` green;
create→exec→fs→eval→terminate cycle driven by tests running *inside* the VM
(no macOS tunnel yet). Port the firecracker-deno `smoke:lima` pattern as
`deno task test:vm` (provisions/reuses the Lima VM, runs the in-VM suite).
**Exit:** in-VM integration suite green on aarch64 locally and x86_64 on a
KVM CI runner (runner = "the Lima VM", no Lima involved).
**Demo:** `deno task test:vm` from a Mac → real microVM sandbox lifecycle.

### M6 — hostd control plane (7 pts)

`studiobox-hostd`: HostControl bootstrap → negotiate → authenticate (gate +
token, provisioned via `limactl` copy); leases (TTL, renew, revoke,
session-vs-duration timeout clocks); capacity ledger + `HostCapacityError`;
list/attach/metadata/usage; hostd↔rootd supervisor client.
**Exit:** lease expiry kills sandboxes; over-capacity create fails fast;
attach from a second client observes the first's sandbox; restart of hostd
revokes leases and tickets.
**Demo:** two concurrent clients, capacity exhaustion, clean recovery.

### M7 — End-to-end tunnel (6 pts)

`openTunnel` → ticket → `SBXTUN1` preface → burn-before-bridge →
`openBridge` → vsock splice. Client on macOS drives the full SandboxAgent
plane against a real guest.
**Exit:** E2E exec/fs/eval from macOS through the complete path; ticket
replay/expiry/rate-limit tests; tunnel teardown propagates EOF both ways and
frees the port; vsock dial racing VMM death yields the typed error, not a
hang (leans on firecracker-deno's dial-races-death contract).
**Demo:** `sandbox.sh` from a Mac terminal, microVM answering.

### M8 — Public SDK, Tier A complete (8 pts)

Install the real provider behind the carried API façade: `Sandbox.create/
connect` (ID grammar `sbx_loc_…`), full `sh` builder semantics, spawn/
ChildProcess stdio contract ("inherit" = client-side pipe), complete `fs.*`
(incl. upload/download, walk/expandGlob, FsFile), `env.*`, `deno.eval/repl/
run` (+ `DenoProcess.fetch`, `httpReady`), `Sandbox.fetch`, timeout/memory
grammars, error taxonomy. Write **PARITY.md** (every Tier B/C divergence).
**Exit:** the parity fixture suite passes against real sandboxes (in-VM CI) —
same file that ran against FakeSandboxHost in M3; a `@deno/sandbox` demo
script runs unmodified except the import line.
**Demo:** README quickstart is real.

### M9 — Host lifecycle automation (5 pts)

`./cli`: `host up|down|status|doctor|provision` (idempotent; `--recreate`;
`--no-lima` for Linux); Lima template committed; systemd units; token mint;
health/doctor incl. quarantine listing.
**Exit:** fresh Mac → `host up` → quickstart works in one sitting; doctor
detects and reports a deliberately wedged daemon.
**Demo:** cold-start-to-sandbox screencastable flow.

### M10 — Tier B emulations (6 pts)

`exposeHttp` (port range lease → `http://127.0.0.1:<port>`); `allowNet`
nftables egress per TAP (+ dnsmasq/ipset for wildcard hosts); `region`
metadata echo; oom boolean (137 + memory.events); `SandboxOptions.env`
post-create application; labels; `extendTimeout` actual-deadline semantics.
**Exit:** parity fixtures extended to Tier B rows; egress tests prove
allow/deny both ways; exposed HTTP survives sandbox restarts of *other*
sandboxes (port isolation).

### M11 — Hardening + the 1.0 soak (9 pts)

Resource enforcement to the ledger (cgroup cpu quota, `pids.max`,
memory.max backstop, overlay quota, daemon fd budgets); pinned-TLS on
control + tunnel listeners (staged decision lands here); structured logs +
diagnostics bundle; fleet reconcile drills.
**The soak drill (the 1.0 bar, runs in CI on both arches):**
- ≥200 sequential + batched create→use(sh/fs/eval)→terminate cycles;
- kill -9 rootd mid-fleet at random points, restart, reconcile; repeat ≥10×;
- assertions after every phase: zero leaked VMM/jailer processes, TAPs,
  netns, nftables rules, mounts, overlay files, jail roots, port
  reservations, journal entries outside terminal phases; daemon RSS and
  journal-dir size bounded; create p95 within target on warm cache.
**Exit:** soak green on aarch64 + x86_64 three consecutive scheduled runs.

### M12 — Docs + 0.1.0 release (4 pts)

Docs (permissions matrix per daemon, threat model, PARITY.md polish,
macos/linux host guides, testing-your-app with FakeSandboxHost); JSR publish
(the `@nullstyle/capnp`-on-JSR prerequisite is already satisfied); tag-driven
release workflow (configure the JSR GitHub-Actions publishing link from day
one — the firecracker-deno lesson).
**Exit:** `deno add jsr:@nullstyle/studiobox` + quickstart verbatim in a
fresh project.

**Total: ~88 pts ≈ 6–7 focused weeks.** 1.0 is declared when M11's soak
holds across releases, not at M12 — 0.x continues until the soak criteria
have survived real use.

### Post-1.0 horizon (explicitly out of scope until then)

Volumes/snapshots mapped onto Firecracker snapshots + overlay images;
secret-on-the-wire via TLS-terminating egress proxy; `exposeSsh` /
`exposeVscode`; warm sandbox pools for sub-second create; multi-host
federation; live adoption (requires an upstream adoption API in
firecracker-deno — coordinate, don't fork).

## 4. Testing strategy

| Tier | Needs | Runs | What lives here |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| T1 unit | nothing | everywhere, every PR | escaping, preface codec, CAS store, validators, ledger math, ID grammars |
| T2 fake | UDS only | macOS + Linux, every PR | FakeFirecracker + fake VMM/jailer shims (from `@nullstyle/firecracker/testing`), FakeSandboxHost, rootd/hostd logic, parity fixtures v1 |
| T3 in-VM | Linux + KVM | x86_64 CI runners; aarch64 via `test:vm` (Lima) | real jailer/microVM/vsock/studioboxd, parity fixtures v2, reconcile drills |
| T4 e2e | macOS + Lima | scheduled + pre-release | full topology client→hostd→rootd→guest, tunnel, CLI flows |
| soak | T3 env | scheduled (M11+) | the 1.0 drill |

Parity is enforced two ways: **compile parity** (a fixture that imports both
SDKs and type-checks shared call sites against the carried inventory) and
**behavior parity** (one fixture suite, three backends: FakeSandboxHost →
in-VM real → e2e).

CI mirrors firecracker-deno's proven shape: check + drift gates
(`wire:check`, `compat:check`, parity-inventory drift), test matrix
(ubuntu-24.04 + macos × Deno floor + latest), KVM integration job with udev
rule, compile-smoke for daemons/agent on both arches, concurrency-canceling
groups, tag-gated publish.

## 5. Risks

| # | Risk | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| R1 | the published codegen still fails on our five-schema bundle | M1 is first and gated; gaps fixed upstream + consumed as patches; fallback = single-file schema merge (loses modularity, keeps ordinals) |
| R2 | WASM session core misbehaves compiled/in-guest | M1 gate 4 proves it before anything depends on it; last-resort fallback is a pure-TS session core (large) — decide only on hard failure |
| R3 | copy staging blows the 2 s create p95 | measure at M5; levers: smaller golden rootfs (debootstrap --variant=minbase, or Alpine), parallel copies, warm page cache, pre-staged spare jails |
| R4 | debootstrap reproducibility drifts | pin `snapshot.debian.org` epoch in the manifest |
| R5 | nested-virt constraints (M3+ Mac, macOS 15+) | documented requirement; Linux `--no-lima` path is first-class |
| R6 | in-guest Deno vsock needs unstable flags / regresses | settle on the pinned guest Deno at M1; `DENO_SERVE_ADDRESS=vsock:` as alternate serving path |
| R7 | upstream `@deno/sandbox` moves (0.13.x → …) | parity inventory regen task + pinned-target policy: track latest, hold a two-minor compat window, PARITY.md records the delta |
| R8 | scope creep vs. one maintainer | Tier C stays Tier C until the soak holds; the horizon list is a fence, not a menu |
| R9 | an M1 qualification gap needs a breaking `@nullstyle/capnp` change | same maintainer on both sides — fix upstream, pin the new release; 0.x semver churn is acceptable while studiobox is pre-release (no vendoring escape hatch, by decision) |

## 6. Immediate next actions (M0)

1. `git init`, commit the founding docs (this file, DESIGN.md, README,
   LICENSE).
2. Execute the carry-forward map from `../limabox` with the mechanical
   rename; get the carried test suite green.
3. Swap firecracker imports to `jsr:@nullstyle/firecracker@^0.2` +
   `deno.local.json` overrides.
4. Stand up CI (check + T1/T2 + compile smoke) — green board before M1
   starts.
